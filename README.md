# yii2-schema-breadcrumbs

Use data structured breadcrumbs from [schema.org](https://schema.org/BreadcrumbList) on yii2 projects.

## How to install

It will works automatically if you didn't override the default template.

## Documentation

This widget should be work as good as the yii2 official. So, I won't copy/paste
their documentation.
